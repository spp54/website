   <p id= "My_intro";>Routers (the three disk shaped devices) basically do what is said in their name. They route network traffic from one network to another. If the laptop on the bottom left sends traffic to the laptop on the right the first router 'Medan' would look at the destination address in the massage and say to itself 'thats not for me its for the 'jakata' router and send the message out the correct interface. The Jakata router would look at the message and say 'thats not for me its for 'Surabaya  and send the massage out the correct interface. Finally the Surabaya router would look at the message and say ' thats for a network connected to to' and send the message to the correct destination network'  </p>
