<h3 id="My_intro">Hi, I'm steve. I have been studying and practicing the art of network engineering for 3 years. I have a passion for all things routing and switching, how these devices are connected together, how they 'talk' each other so that millions of people around the planet can share resources, chat, play games, develop software, work, meet people, say hello and a whole lot of other stuff.<br/>If you want to know more about me click the above link to the 'About Me' page<br/>If you wish to contact me click the 'Contact Me' link above<br/><br/>Their are three devices you will come across consistently in networking. One is the 'Hub', one is the 'Switch' and the other one is the 'Router'.<br/>Lets learn about these devices and how they differ by clicking the links below.</h3>
