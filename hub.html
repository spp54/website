       <p id= "My_intro";>The Hub ( the box in the middle) is a antiquated piece kit rarely seen in modern networks. Everything it see's coming in on its ports is blindly transmitted out on all its other ports wasting bandwidth and slowing down the network. As the technology has evolved the switch was born. The switch has many performance advantages over the hub. My long dead Granny used a hub as a door stop in her backroom.  </p>
